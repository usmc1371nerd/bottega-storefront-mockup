HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a mock up for Bottega College to be intergrated into there existing website. 

Hosted with Netlify https://bottega-storefront.netlify.app/ until it is intergrated. 

Final product has not been discussed in any particular foramt but should be mobile compatiable, and be able to view at least 10 products easily by the user. 
Products need to be added to a cart added up and be able to purchase items with users info and address. So we can ensure products are 
getting to the customer/ user.
